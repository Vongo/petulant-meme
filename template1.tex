\section{Story Line}
Our every week meeting are held on "Skype", in the meeting we distrubute new tasks, we process the quallity of what we've done during prevoius week and share our new finding about each part of project with other members.

We use "Trello" as a collaboration tool and task distributer that organizes our project into boards. It provides us what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.

The first step for all of us was compiling the project on our systems. This part was a bit challenging as it needs so many libraries and dependencies. Then we tried to get familiar with the code. The next step was one of the most important parts, to choose useful and inovative feature in order to implement. All team members search and study about it and finally we ask community to confirm the most effective and we started to distrubte the tasks for that specific feature.

\section{Project Planning and Management}
Complex projects will usually involve highly qualified specialist project managers. We are trying following tools for our project management.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Work Breakdown Structure: 
We planned start by breaking down the overall objective into smaller packages, until each parcel 
of work is self-contained and can be attributed to one or more than one team members.
\item Dependencies: 
We list the tasks and which depend on the completion of which before they can begin. At this 
point we can also estimate how long each will take. 
This kind of analysis allows projects to be planned to make the most effective use of time and 
resources, and to deliver key outcomes and milestones to a specific timetable. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Quality Process}
Every software development needs to be focused on the delivery of quality. One of the most important customer service skills is the ability to understand and effectively respond to the customerâ€™s needs and concerns. Quality process must be a part of the entire software development life cycle (SDLC) from inception through implementation.

We see quality process fundamentally as a way of solving problems. Once we sense a problem, good problem solving technique involves alternating between the levels of thought and experience. For instance, after we sense a problem, we should collect some data to get insight regarding the area of the problem,
choose the specific relevant improvement activity we will undertake, collect some more
data, analyze the data to find the causes of the problem, plan a solution and try it, collect
some more data to evaluate the effects of the new solution, standardize on the solution if
it works, and conclude by reflecting on what we did.

We use the following steps to ensure that we measure the right quality-control factors in the right way.
\begin{itemize}
\item Determine what to measure.
\item Determine our measurement process by selecting the best process for our needs.
\item Define exactly how we'll use the selected measurement process.
\item Perform the measurements and compare to customer specifications.
\item Confirm the quality of our data with compare-and-review checks and the help of a computer.
\item Make sense of our data with coding and different data charts.
\end{itemize}
